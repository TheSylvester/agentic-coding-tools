- Ignore README.md in this directory (it's for the marketplace, not instructions).
- Ignore .cursor/ and .agent/ directories (cross-platform ports for Cursor IDE and Gemini CLI).
- When generating .md files, always write to a '<project-root>/.ai-reference/' folder. Never add .md files to the repo.
- After generating any markdown prompts/specs/task files: /reflect to refine the product file(s) against the existing context where it could help.
- Default to researching, sharing insight, and planning. Take implementation actions only when asked.
- When I say "lsa to" it means "launch a sub-agent to", and when I say "lpsa to" it means "launch parallel sub-agents to".
- ALWAYS use sub-agents where possible for:
  - **Parallel execution** of independent tasks (multi-file analysis, concurrent tests/builds)
  - **Exploration & filtering** to scout codebases or research topics, returning only relevant findings
  - **Focused analysis** in isolated context (single or parallel), then synthesizing conclusions in main thread
- If you start a server and hit a port conflict, check `lsof -i :<port>`—if it's a prior instance of what you're starting, kill it and retry. Clean up any servers you start before session end.
